&lt;p&gt;Because of the lack of information, high uncertainty, the need to make decisions quickly, founders of startups use lots of heuristics and exhibit biases in their startup actions. Biases and heuristics are parts of our cognitive toolboxes in the decision making process, and they help us to take a decision as quick as possible under uncertainty, but sometimes become erroneous and fallacious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs often become not only overconfident about their startups but also about their personal influence on an outcome (case of illusion of control).
